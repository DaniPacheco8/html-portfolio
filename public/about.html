<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>  Hello everyone, my name is Daniella, I'm a Brazilian who currently lives in Barcelona.</p>

<p>Having performed different roles in the past, I originally graduated in Dentistry, but changed careers and entered the world of technology 6 years ago working as a Customer Success Leader, focusing on optimizing organizational culture, results and ensuring the best journey for the customers. </p>

<p>I also worked as a Business Analyst at a large technology company, focusing on Requirements and Business process analysis, Stakeholder Management, facilitating sessions and managing product backlog using Agile methodologies. I stayed there until 2023 when unfortunately I was affected by one of the layoffs.</p>

<p>Now I'm looking for new challenges and starting my studies to become a fullstack developer.</p>

<p>I believe I am an extremely communicative, empathetic person with positive energy, and I am confident that I can contribute significantly to my future team.</p>
